 <h1> RC Aircraft</h1>
INTRODUCTION

A radio-controlled aircraft (often called RC aircraft or RC plane) is a small flying machine that is controlled remotely by an operator on the ground using a hand-held radio transmitter. The transmitter communicates with a receiver within the craft that sends signals to servomechanisms (servos) which move the control surfaces based on the position of joysticks on the transmitter.

Planes fly by virtue of Bernoulli's principle on their wings. Air being pushed under the wings only accounts for a small portion of the lift forces that make an airplane fly. The real lift forces results from the partial vaccum created above the wings (Bernoulli's principle). In effect, a plane rises on account that it wings are being "sucked up" from above.
To get the Bernoulli effect (and to lift the plane), the wings must expose a larger surface on top than below the wing. A curved wing does just that.
Second, we need to maintain a flow of air over and under the wings. This is the job of the engine, which pulls the plane and its wings forward, using a propeller. Once the airplane accelerates to take to a speed sufficient to generate enough lift for the airplane to fly, the airplane can take off.
